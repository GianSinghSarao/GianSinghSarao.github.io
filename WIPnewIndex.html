        Portfolio
      </h2>
      <p>
        This page is supposed to be a list of projects I have worked on. So far, I have no serious projects. None. All I
        have are this page and a couple of odd side projects that I worked on for a while then ran out of motivation to
        finish up. Though seeing my own projects on here does occasionally motivate me, so I might as well list my side
        projects here. Feel free to flick through the Git repositories. Who knows? Maybe you might find some interesting
        oddities.

        <h3>The String Encrypter</h3>
        <h4>Story</h4>
        <p>
          This project was the result of following a tutorial about a deprecated/obsolete tech stack while researching something
          else entirely. My original goal was to find a method to pack a web page into a single file that the user can download
          and use. Example applications would be HTML eBooks, and reference pages, but as a single file download. 
          <br>
          I came across HTA files and a tutorial on how to make a string encrypter. It seemed interesting so I followed the short
          tutorial to the end, then I began to customize it by putting in my nickname, and getting rid of the tacky marquee
          element usage.
          <img alt="string encrypter prior to v1">
          Objectively speaking, this was a fairly rubbish application that relied on internet explorer being pre-installed and
          VBScript not being disabled. Moreover it was an application that existed only to show off the features of HTAs, the
          main one being that instead of running in a browser tab with an address bar, it ran in an almost entirely chromeless
          window. Remember, offline pages still existed in some form or another, even if not as easy for the end-user as it is
          today. Albeit imperfect, clicking "Save Page As" in the context menu of a page was a common occurence.
          <br>
          Of course, as one would expect from an article about an already dying technology, the application made for it, had light
          styling, to put it nicely, but frankly, considering most websites and templates at the time were made using libraries 
          like bootstrap 3, it looked pathetically ugly.
          <br>
          So I tried to improve it and failed. Mainly because I wanted to first begin reducing it's dependencies on IE, and 
          then potentially introduce better styling. I was already stuck on the first step because, for an amatuer like myself,
          who had only ever copied and pasted js, and not written much outside of codeacedamy lessons, the difference in syntax 
          and types between VBScript and JavaScript was already difficult to consolidate. 
          <br>
          <i>
            Of course, I was still a Bootstrap 3 Pro, who could reflexively type up a whole jumbotron-centred page layout in html, 
            and I was still a batch prodigy, who could easily write batch scripts to stagger startup of background services. I was
            even rocking a dual monitor setup between my PC and the living room TV which I had setup entirely myself while still 
            in primary school.
          </i>
          <br>
          <b>
            Anyway...
          </b>
          Appalled by the ugliness of the application, I had completely forgotten my original goal(which in hindsight had already
          been fulfilled by PDFs) and began my attempt at improving the code.
          <br>
          After trying and failing to convert the VBScript to JavaScript using a random website, I started trying to convert it
          by hand, by googling unknown terms from the VBScript, but after just one night learning a new language I gave up on
          translating the VBScript, and I started looking for a new solution to desktop HTML apps.
          <br>
          Instead of trying to improve it, I now wanted to rewrite it entirely, but with different goals. I wanted something
          simple that could run on any os without dependending on IE, or IE specific behaviours, and as far as I could tell the
          best solution was to just inline all the resources into the HTML. This would later be called the String Encrypter V2.
          with (Beta) in its name, because its still being developed.
          <br>
          So I opened up chrome, and started coding. Just to be clear, I didn't open notepad or some other text editor. I just
          started writing HTML+CSS+JS in chrome's "omnibox". In case you don't know, Chrome was less strict about data URL
          security back in those days so it worked and without any caveats. Whenever I wanted to test the layout or something
          similar, I would press enter to load the html as a page, then edit the URL again to edit the page. No need for a live
          server.
          <br>
          In new tabs, I opened the minified css and js of a relatively new framework called MDL and copied and pasted each into
          the appropriate style or script tag in the data url. I even wanted to inline fonts and favicons, but after some
          googling in another new tab, I realized that it was probably imposible to do. So I moved on, onto the interface.
          <br>
          At this point, I had inlined a whole framework, but the app was still unusable because I had no cryptography function
          that was written in js. So I decided to save my work for later, which involved pressing enter to load the page, and then
          clicking the bookmark icon, to make a bookmark which will remember the url for me.
          <br>
          A short while later, maybe a week or two, I was in school attending lessons, perhaps History, perhaps Geography, I can't
          remember. Point is, at that time, we were given school laptops, and told to do some research, and so I did, Except not
          about the subject, whatever it was, but about encryption, and it was difficult. There was some math that I to this day
          think that I will probably never understand. 
          <br>
          So I looked around for some other code, at which point I found a page with a short algorithm to encrypt some data using
          bitwise XOR, which as an amatuer and basically a script kiddie, blew my mind. I tried some experiments in Chrome DevTools
          using it, and modified it a bit, then I pasted the modified function, into the URL field of a new bookmark prompt, and
          clicked save, just as the bell rang to signify the end of the lesson.
          <br>
          After hurriedly logging off and returning the school laptop, I went to my next lesson, which as it would happen was
          Computing. As I take a seat at the PC assigned to me, I reflexively log in to my chrome account after logging into my
          AD account (just as I had a couple minutes before when using the laptops). Syncing the newly made bookmark to this
          different device. Though this time, I actually pay attention to the lesson, and leave the experiments till I get home.
          <br>
          Later, at home, I start working on the project again and edit the data url, pasting in the small symmetric encryption
          function, And done. An entirely offline capable single-file, single-page-application.
          <br>
          I cut it out of the omnibox, taking care to highlight everything in it with CTRL-A, and pasted it into an HTML file.
          If I upload it to a server somewhere, and if someone right clicks the open webpage and clicks save page as, they can
          download a single-file, and have it keep it's styles and functionality, even when offline.
          <br>
          Now this was good. It was good, but I wasn't satisfied. After seeing the way I could launch an HTA as if it was an app,
          without any tabs or url bars, this wasn't good enough. And I already knew the widely accepted solution to this problem
          was to make a chrome app. But that would lock it into chrome. What about firefox or IE users?
          <br>
          Then while googling I discovered Electron. In the early days, and even now I suppose, Electron was the best way to get
          native like os integration for web apps. So I tried it. I copied the HTML file I wrote in the omnibox, and a tiny
          main.js file from the docs, into the app directory in the folder containing prebuilt Electron binaries and launched the
          app. And it worked wonderfully well. I only realised the problems with Electron apps years later. 
          <br>
          I even showed it off to the few people in my computing class who knew how difficult it was to make a well designed GUI
          desktop application. Most others would think it was cool, then go back to messing with the indentation of the python
          which they were blindly typing in.
          <br>
          Then progress on the program stopped, mainly because literally nobody used it, not even me who made it. I turned the
          algorithm used within, into it's own separate library, but made sure to add a disclaimer about it being insecure for
          anything serious. This had the obvious effect of preventing anyone who stumbled upon it accidentally using it, and
          getting their data breached. I didn't want to get blamed for misleading others into thinking it's actually secure. 
          <br>
          Fast forward some years, and I decide to bury the Electron version, because now I know that Electron is bulky and mostly
          uneccessary for many desktop apps. Plus, the rate at which bugs are found in chromium and therefore electron was
          picking up. There was no way I could keep releasing new builds of the app. But now, with enough knowledge to actually
          rewrite the old HTA, I invest some time and effort into trying to modernise it. In contrast to the past, I actually
          succeed this time, at least to a certain degree, and I record some milestones on GitHub, though some of my work gets 
          buried in rebases, and force-pushes.
